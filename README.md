MATRIX OPERATIONS – ASSIGNMENT README

This repository contains solutions for fundamental matrix operations including transpose, symmetry checks, and arithmetic operations. Each program demonstrates loops, conditions, and logical reasoning in programming.


**TASK 1: TRANSPOSE OF A MATRIX**

Subtask 1A: Rectangular Matrix

Input: A rectangular matrix with multiple rows and columns

Method: Use a separate matrix to store the transposed values

Output: A new matrix where rows and columns are interchanged

Subtask 1B: In-Place Square Matrix

Input: A square matrix with equal number of rows and columns

Method: Modify the original matrix by swapping elements across the diagonal

Output: The original matrix is converted into its transpose without using a second matrix

**TASK 2: SYMMETRIC MATRIX CHECK**

Definition: A matrix is symmetric if it is identical to its transpose

Conditions:

The matrix must be square

The elements must mirror across the main diagonal

Output: The program prints whether the matrix is symmetric or not

**TASK 3: SKEW-SYMMETRIC MATRIX CHECK**

Definition: A matrix is skew-symmetric if it is equal to the negative of its transpose

Conditions:

The matrix must be square

All diagonal elements must be zero

The elements must be opposite across the main diagonal

Output: The program prints whether the matrix is skew-symmetric

**TASK 4: MATRIX OPERATIONS**

Addition

Description: Adds two matrices of the same size element by element

Output: A new matrix containing the sum

Subtraction

Description: Subtracts one matrix from another of the same size element by element

Output: A new matrix containing the difference

Multiplication

Description: Multiplies two compatible matrices according to matrix multiplication rules

Output: A new matrix containing the product
